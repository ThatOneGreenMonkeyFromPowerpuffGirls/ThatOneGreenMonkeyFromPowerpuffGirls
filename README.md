- 👋 Hi, I'm Mojo Jojo - Sworn enemy of Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, destroying The Powerpuff Girls, crush Townsville, and conquer the world. In that order.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science in Year 12 and the whereabouts of those flying RATS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on WORLD DOMINATION and freedom of monkeys everywhere.
